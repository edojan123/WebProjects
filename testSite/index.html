		<b>Pediatric brain cancer</b>
		<br>
		Brain cancer is the most common solid childhood tumor and the leading cause of cancer-related death in children under the age of 14 years. Patients that do survive often suffer from severe side effects, highlighting the urgent need for improved treatment strategies. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that the term brain cancer covers a wide variety of different tumor entities, including medulloblastoma, glioma, AT/RT and ependymoma, each of them being further subclassified into multiple subtypes with different biological and clinical characteristics. As each subtype may require a unique approach for its eradication, defining the appropriate therapy for each tumor type will require substantial further research efforts.<br>

		We believe that this wide variety of brain tumor subtypes is a reflection of the strong heterogeneity of the (developing) brain. Although this organ may appear like a uniform gray mass from the outside, there are profound differences in gene expression patterns, usage of signaling pathways, and biological functions along its axes. Moreover, these features undergo dynamic changes during the development of the brain. Especially for pediatric brain cancer, it is important to understand when and how the brain changes over time, as this will have an impact on the biology and behavior of the tumor that arises at a given moment during child development. This is why in our lab, we strive to combine the study of normal brain development with that of its oncogenic counterpart.

		<b>Neural development and chromatin structure</b>
		<br>
		Neural development is an ongoing process that starts early in the first trimester of pregnancy when the neuro-ectoderm undergoes a process termed neurulation, the formation of the primitive neural tube. As the fetus develops, the neural tube expands and folds, creating the familiar structure of the mature human brain. Proliferation in the brain continues long after birth and contributes to major regions of the brain. Both before and after birth, these rapidly proliferating cells are potential targets for tumor formation, as every cell division brings along an inherent risk for genomic damage. This is evidenced by the frequent occurrence of brain tumors in regions of high (perinatal) proliferation. At the molecular level, cellular differentiation during development is accompanied by structural changes in the chromatin. It is therefore not surprising that in addition to genes involved in cell cycle progression and maintenance of genomic integrity, genes that modify the chromatin are frequently found mutated in pediatric brain cancer.

		<b>Medulloblastoma and high grade glioma</b>
		<br>
		The research in our lab concentrates on the brain cancers medulloblastoma and high grade glioma. Both tumor types are highly malignant and show evidence of high-jacking of normal developmental control pathways as well as epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. To study these phenomena in their proper context, we have generated in vitro and in vivo models for these cancers based on their predicted cell-of-origin (i.e., the original healthy cell that has undergone oncogenic transformation). The research projects in our lab focus on the role of Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway
		usage in the developing medulloblastoma cell-of-origin and how this affects medulloblastoma subtype formation; on chromatin regulation and mitotic integrity during medulloblastoma and glioma cell-of-origin development and oncogenic transformation; and on (phospho)protein signaling in medulloblastoma.
